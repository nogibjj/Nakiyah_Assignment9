# Google Colab Notebook Setup and Sharing Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up a Google Colab notebook, writing code, and sharing your work with collaborators.

## Step 1: Access Google Colab
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) in your browser.
2. Sign in with your Google account, if needed.
3. Create a new notebook by selecting **File > New notebook**.

## Step 2: Write Code in Colab
1. Use code cells to write Python code. For example:
   ```python
   print("Hello, Data Science!")
   ```
2. Execute cells with the "Play" button or by pressing `Shift + Enter`.
3. Install and import necessary libraries (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, `tensorflow`) with `!pip install` commands.

## Step 3: Collaborate and Share
1. Click **Share** in the top-right corner.
2. Set permissions for collaborators (e.g., Viewer, Commenter, or Editor).
3. Copy the shareable link to send to collaborators or save in your repository for easy access.

## Step 4: Save and Access Files
1. Save progress directly to your Google Drive.
2. Use `%cd /content/drive/MyDrive` to access and store project files in Drive.

## Example Repository Integration
1. Include the Colab link in your repo's README under "Setup Instructions" or "Notebook Access."
2. Direct team members to the README for Colab setup and collaboration.
