# Google Colab Notebook Setup and Sharing Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up a Google Colab notebook, writing code, and sharing your work with collaborators.

## Step 1: Access Google Colab
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) in your browser.
2. Sign in with your Google account, if needed.
3. Create a new notebook by selecting **File > New notebook**.

## Step 2: Write Code in Colab
1. Use code cells to write Python code. For example:
   ```python
   print("Hello, Data Science!")
   ```
2. Execute cells with the "Play" button or by pressing `Shift + Enter`.
3. Install and import necessary libraries (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, `tensorflow`) with `!pip install` commands.

## Step 3: Collaborate and Share
1. In your Colab notebook, go to **File > Save a copy in GitHub**.
2. Select the appropriate GitHub repository and add a description of your changes.
3. Click **OK** to save the notebook directly to your GitHub repository.

## Step 4: Edit and Update through VSCode
1. Open VSCode and clone the repository with:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Make edits as needed to the notebook or other files in the cloned repository.
3. After making changes, save the files, stage them, and commit your changes in VSCode:
   - **Stage Changes**: Go to the **Source Control** panel, click **+** next to the files.
   - **Commit Changes**: Enter a commit message and click the checkmark icon.
4. Push the updates to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

## Example Repository Integration
1. Include the Colab link in your repo's README under "Setup Instructions" or "Notebook Access."
2. Direct team members to the README for Colab setup and collaboration.
